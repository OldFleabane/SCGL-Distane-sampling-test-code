This is a test poject using R to clean and analyze Distance Smapling data collected on the SCGL sampling trip for DBG.

The RMD file currently pulls data from a local directory, not linked to any sharepoint, teams, or otherwised shared directory, so this needs to be updated 
before other people are able to use this. 

The data_raw folder should contain the relevant .csv's to use, the files missing are the shapefiles I pulled directly from ArcGIS online. 

'R_Distance_package_notes.Rmd' is just a test file for getting familiar with the package 'Distance'. Can be ignored.
