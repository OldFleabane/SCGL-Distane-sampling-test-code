# [Sclerocactus Distance Sampling]{.underline}

End goals:

-   Plot the individual observations for each site on a coordinate grid
-   Mark the observations which overlap/were observed both going NS & EW.
-   Get a percent observational error to apply across the observed population.

Site names: 3 & 1= Picnic, 10= Bridgport, 12= Fram

## Setting Up

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# tidyverse contains both 'dyplr' and 'ggplot2'
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)
library(ggrepel)

scgl_obs <- read_csv("data_raw/distanceSampling_1.csv")
scgl_trans_length <- read_csv("data_raw/transect_2.csv")

scgl_obs <- clean_names(scgl_obs)
```

This function will be used later to find duplicate plants

```{r test function}

# `site` = a dataframe with relative (x,y) coords as seperate columns `x` & `y`, transect directions as `NS` & `EW`, and unique `plant_id' for each observation.
# `b` = an allowance in meters(m) within which two observations (1 NS & 1 EW) will be considered the same observation
crossed <- function(site, b){
  
 temp_site <-  site %>% 
    rowwise() %>% 
    mutate(coord = list(c(x,y)))
  
#chart all possible combinations of NS coordinates and EW coordinates
 grid <-  expand.grid(EW = temp_site[which( site$transect_orientation == "EW"), "coord"]$coord,
                      NS = temp_site[which( site$transect_orientation == "NS"), "coord"]$coord) %>% 
    rowwise() %>% 
   #make a column of distances between points
    mutate( dist = sqrt(sum((EW - NS)^2))) %>% 
   #filter the combinations to only the ones within the supplied fuzziness `b`
    filter(dist <= b)

#appending to contain columns with EW plant_id's for each combination
grid <- left_join(grid, temp_site[, c("coord", "plant_id")],
                  by = join_by(EW == coord)) %>% 
  mutate(EW_ID = plant_id, plant_id = NULL) %>% 
#appending to contain columns with NS plant_id's for each combination
        left_join(temp_site[, c("coord", "plant_id")], 
                  by = join_by(NS == coord)) %>% 
  mutate(NS_ID = plant_id, plant_id = NULL)

#checking for Id's with multiple matches.(Should be only one distinct NS observation for each distinct EW observation). Keep only the match with the least distance between points
if(!all(count(grid, NS_ID)$n >1)){
grid <- filter(group_by(grid, NS_ID), dist == min(dist))
grid <- filter(group_by(grid, EW_ID), dist == min(dist))
}

#Within the original dataframe, change corresponding EW ID's to their NS counterparts
temp_site <- left_join(temp_site, grid[, c("EW_ID", "NS_ID")], by = join_by(plant_id == EW_ID)) %>% 
  mutate( plant_id = ifelse( !is.na(NS_ID), NS_ID, plant_id), NS_ID = NULL, coord = NULL) %>% 
  ungroup()
  
temp_site
  
} 

```

```{r}
scgl <- scgl_obs[!(is.na(scgl_obs$transect_meter_mark|scgl_obs$distance_to_group)),] %>% #filtering NA's and outliers. 
        filter(transect_meter_mark < 110, distance_to_group < 10) %>% 
        mutate( object_id = as.factor(object_id),
                site_name = as.factor(site_name),
                transect_number = as.factor(transect_number))

            
scgl1 <- scgl %>% 
   mutate(
     # EW transect meter marks need to be * -1 because they were recorded as if in the(+,+) quadrant, but the mapping we will do is based on (-,+) quadrant. 
    transect_meter_mark = case_when( 
      transect_orientation == "EW" ~ transect_meter_mark * -1, 
      TRUE ~ transect_meter_mark),
    # making the 'direction to group' indicate if the 'distance to group' needs to be left/right of transect.  
    distance_to_group = case_when(
      direction_to_group == "-" ~ distance_to_group * -1, 
      TRUE ~ distance_to_group ) 
          )
           

# setting up the (X,Y) columns to then transform based on plot/shapefile analysis
scgl1 <- scgl1 %>% 
  mutate( x = case_when(transect_orientation == "NS" ~ distance_to_group, transect_orientation == "EW" ~ transect_meter_mark), 
          y = case_when(transect_orientation == "EW" ~ distance_to_group, transect_orientation == "NS" ~ transect_meter_mark)) 
                
                
#filtering to sites
fram <- scgl1 %>% 
  filter(site_name == "12")

picnic <- scgl1 %>% 
  filter(site_name == "1"| site_name == "3")

```

The raw data needs to be made into a coordinate-grid-friendly format. Each site needs to have the coordinates transformed based on the layout of the transects on the plot.These layouts were recorded via shapefile, so the shapefiles were measured seperately and compared to recorded information to figure out the necessary transformations to the data.

## [Site: Fram]{.underline}

### Plotting individuals

Involves transforming the coordinates to match the plot design.

```{r fram transform}
#transforming Fram coordinates to accurately reflect plot design.This is based on the origin (0,0) being in the lower right of the plot so that one or both of the axis matches the start of at least one transect. In this case, the origins of the three NS transects are at Y = 0, and 4 out of 5 EW transects' origins are at X = 0.
fram_1 <- fram %>% 
  mutate( 
    x = case_when(transect_orientation == "NS" & transect_number == "1" ~ x - 10, 
                  transect_orientation == "NS" & transect_number == "2" ~ x - 20,
                  transect_orientation == "NS" & transect_number == "3" ~ x - 30,
                  transect_orientation == "EW" & transect_number == "5" ~ x - 10,
                  TRUE ~ x
                  ),
    y = case_when(transect_orientation == "EW" & transect_number == "1" ~ y + 10,
                  transect_orientation == "EW" & transect_number == "5" ~ y + 50,
                  transect_orientation == "EW" & transect_number == "7" ~ y + 70,
                  transect_orientation == "EW" & transect_number == "8" ~ y + 80,
                  transect_orientation == "EW" & transect_number == "9" ~ y + 90,
                  TRUE ~ y),
    )

#Fram NS lines tapes were laid backwards making 0 = 100. 
fram_1 <- fram_1 %>% 
  mutate(
    y = case_when(transect_orientation =="NS" ~ ((y - 100)* -1),
                  TRUE ~ y) )

#transect start/stops for mapping
fram_lines <- tibble( x = c(-10, -20, -30, 0, -10, 0, 0, 0), 
                      y = c(0, 0, 0, 10, 50, 70, 80, 90), 
                      xend = c(-10, -20, -30, -33, -33, -60, -65, -39), 
                      yend = c(100, 100, 100, 10, 50, 70, 80, 90),
                      label = c("1NS", "2NS", "3NS", "1EW", "5EW", "7EW", "8EW", "9EW")
                    )


 fram_plot<-  ggplot( data = fram_1, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_segment(data = fram_lines, aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend)) +
   geom_text(data = fram_lines,
            aes( label = label),
            nudge_x = 4,
            size = 2,
            )

  
  fram_plot +
    geom_point(data = fram_1, aes( colour = transect_orientation))+
    coord_fixed(ratio = 1, xlim = c(-75, 10), ylim = c(0, 100))
```

### Marking Overlap

For the initial marking of overlapping observations we will use an **allowance of 0.5m.**

`plant_id` = unique identifiers for each observation

`zoned` = is observation within the 3m\*3m square at transect intersections? (1 or 0)

```{r fram dupes and plot}
#add unique plant ID's for each observation =`plant_id'
fram_id <- mutate(fram_1, plant_id = c(1:nrow(fram_1)))

# add a variable to indicate if an observation is within the 3m*3m square at the intersections of NS & EW transects. 
# `zoned` column: 1 = within zone, 0 = not within zone
fram_id <- mutate(fram_id, zoned = case_when( c(rowSums(mapply( FUN = function(a, b){between(a, b-3, b+3)}, fram_id[, "y"], c(10, 50, 70, 80, 90))) +
                                                rowSums(mapply( FUN = function(a, b){between(a, b-3, b+3)}, fram_id[, "x"], c(-10, -20, -30)))) == 2 ~ 1,
       TRUE ~ 0)) 

#using the custom function to find overlapping observations   
fram_duped <- crossed(filter(fram_id), 1)  # a = plot data w/ID's, b = fuzziness

fram_plot1 <- fram_duped %>% 
  filter(zoned == 1) %>% #show only zoned observations
  filter( duplicated(plant_id)) %>% #show only overlapping observations
  ggplot( mapping = aes( x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue",) +
  geom_point(data = filter(fram_duped, zoned == 1), shape = 1, aes( color = transect_orientation) ) + #plot all zoned observations
  geom_segment(data = fram_lines, aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend)) +
  coord_fixed(ratio = 1, xlim = c(-75, 10), ylim = c(0, 100)) +
  geom_text_repel( data = filter(fram_duped, duplicated(plant_id)), aes( label = plant_id), size = 3, min.segment.length = 0.1) +  # label the overlapping observations
  geom_text(data = fram_lines,
            aes( label = label),
            nudge_x = 4,
            size = 2,
            )


fram_plot1  

  
```

Dark blue points are overlapping observations based on fuzziness provided in the `crossed()` function

### Observational Error

Use a loop to filter down to only cactus that *should* have been seen both going EW & NS. The Observational Error calculated will be applied separately to NS & EW actual observations and then averaged together. This is meant to avoid double counting of overlapping observations.

```{r fram cross sectioned}
#  error comes from the number if plants were seen going NS AND EW divided by number if plants seen going NS OR EW within the 3 meter crossing zone

ob_error_fram <- (nrow(filter(fram_duped, duplicated(plant_id))) / nrow(filter(fram_duped, zoned == 1)))
```

```{r echo=FALSE}

#  error comes from the number if plants were seen going NS AND EW divided by number if plants seen going NS OR EW within the 3 meter crossing zone

print(paste("Observational error =", ob_error_fram, sep = " "))
print(paste("Actual number of unique cactus = ", n_distinct(fram_duped$plant_id), sep = " " ))
#should be the corrected number of observations. 
print( paste("Corrected number of observations =",
             mean( c(n_distinct(which(fram_duped$transect_orientation == "NS"))/
                       ob_error_fram, 
                     n_distinct(which(fram_duped$transect_orientation == "EW"))/
                       ob_error_fram)) , sep = " ")) 


```

### Changing fuzziness

```{r}

#make a curve that shows how the number of corrected observations changes as you change the fuzziness

fuzziness <- c(seq(0, 3, by = 0.1))
 
      error = fuzziness
      n_duplicated = fuzziness
      n_actual = fuzziness 
      n_corrected = fuzziness
    
    
for (fuzz in fuzziness){

fram_crazy <- crossed(fram_id, fuzz)

temp_error <-  which(error == as.character(fuzz))  
   error[which(error == as.character(fuzz))] <- (nrow(filter(fram_crazy, duplicated(plant_id))) / nrow(filter(fram_id, zoned == 1)))

   n_duplicated[which(n_duplicated == as.character(fuzz))] <- sum(duplicated(fram_crazy$plant_id))
    
   n_actual[which(n_actual == as.character(fuzz))] <- n_distinct(fram_crazy$plant_id)
   
   n_corrected[temp_error] <- mean( c(n_distinct(which(fram_crazy$transect_orientation == "NS"))/error[temp_error],
                                       n_distinct(which(fram_crazy$transect_orientation == "EW"))/error[temp_error]))

}
      
fram_fuzz <- tibble(fuzziness, error, n_actual, n_duplicated, n_corrected)
 
```

```{r}
  
pivot_longer(fram_fuzz, cols = !fuzziness, names_to= "type", values_to= "count") %>% 
  group_by(type) %>% 
  ggplot( aes(fuzziness, count, color = type))+
  geom_line() +
  labs( x = "Fuzziness (m)")

  


```

This chart shows the change in the calculated number of *overlapping*, *unique*, and *corrected* total observations as the fuzziness is increased from 0m to 3m.

## [Site: Picnic]{.underline}

### Plotting individuals

Involves transforming the coordinates to match the plot design.

```{r picnic transform and plot}

                  ),

## Notes and Errors

-   There is an issue with this `change in fuzziness` section when using larger `fuzziness` in which the `n_duplicated` entries start to seemingly be rewritten to larger amounts than should actually be calculated. This issue is not present in the `crossed` function. The issue only occurs when looping the `crossed` function and writing the `*_fuzz` tables, so probably an issue with how `n_duplicated` is being written or called.
